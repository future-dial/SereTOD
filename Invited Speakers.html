			Following the recent advancements in language modeling and availability of large natural language datasets, the last decade has been flourishing for conversational AI research. The progress also helped emphasize the importance of reasoning over a diverse set of external knowledge and task completion resources for forming relevant, informative, and accurate responses, discussing with the users when the available solutions/information are not sufficient, and making proactive suggestions.

For ingesting knowledge in conversations, recent work has mainly grounded conversational responses on knowledge snippets from wikipedia and web documents, with the goals of preventing hallucination and providing users diverse and accurate responses. However, much of the world's knowledge is dynamic and it is spread across diverse resources. Some of these are already structured, such as knowledge graphs. But a majority of them are not structured, for example, news articles and books. And some of them also include subjective information, such as customer reviews. In this talk, I will discuss our recent work on integrating knowledge to conversation responses from such a diverse set of resources, challenges associated with these, and progress we made so far.

					<p style="padding: 20px 30px 10px;font-size: 16px;padding-top: 0;text-align: justify;"><b>Abstract:</b> 
					For a virtual assistant, it seems clear that users who have a higher-quality experience would tend to use the assistant more. But causality is less obvious — for example, does higher usage frequency result from higher-quality interactions, or is higher usage frequency a reflection of higher user proficiency? How does user proficiency change over time? In this talk I'll cover a quantitative investigation into the relationships between usage frequency, user proficiency, and interaction quality for a real-world virtual assistant. The insights from this study may help inform reward or loss functions for virtual assistants optimized with reinforcement or semi-supervised learning. This is joint work with colleagues Zidi Xiu, Kai-Chen Cheng, David Q. Sun, Jiannan Lu, Hadas Kotek, Paul McCarthy, Yuhan Zhang, Christopher Klein, and Stephen Pulman.

					<p style="padding: 20px 30px 10px;font-size: 16px;padding-top: 0;text-align: justify;"><b>Abstract:</b>
					Conversational AI (ConvAI) systems have applications ranging from personal assistance, health assistance to customer services. They have been in place since the first call centre agent went live in the late 1990s. More recently, smart speakers and smartphones are powered with conversational AI with similar architecture as those from the 90s. On the other hand, research on ConvAI systems has made leaps and bounds in recent years with sequence-to-sequence, generation-based models. Thanks to the advent of large scale pre-trained language models, state-of-the-art ConvAI systems can generate surprisingly human-like responses to user queries in open domain conversations, known as chit-chat. However, these generation based ConvAI systems are difficult to control and can lead to inappropriate, biased and sometimes even toxic responses. In addition, unlike previous modular conversational AI systems, it is also challenging to incorporate external knowledge into these models for task-oriented dialog scenarios such as personal assistance and customer services, and to maintain consistency. In this talk, I will introduce state-of-the-art generation based conversational AI approaches, and  will point out remaining challenges of conversational AI and possible directions for future research, including how to mitigate inappropriate responses. I will also present some ethical guidelines that conversational AI systems can follow.
